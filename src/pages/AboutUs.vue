      <p>
        Hospital Management System brings together all the information and
        processes of a hospital, in a single platform. It presents you with a
        unified 360-degree view for managing patients, doctors, inventory,
        appointments, billing information, finances and much more. The system
        automatically generates a highly-efficient process and makes it quick.
        Thereby, allowing hospitals to provide quality service in addition to
        professional medical care. In a nutshell, Hospital Management System
        (HMS) creates a frictionless approach towards managing the entire
        hospital and solves all complexities in the process.

        Together with our years of combined experience in Environmental Health
        and Safety, Food Safety and Waste Management, we have found that more
        production time is being wasted on unnecessary paperwork, lack of
        information, training and awareness. With that in mind we have developed
        our own Quality Risk Management Software with the focus on all aspects
        of Environmental Health and Safety, providing a Comprehensively holistic
        approach to health and safety. Our system includes Risk Assessments,
        Daily Inspections , Health and Safety Checklists, Food Safety
        Checklists,Incident and Accident Reporting, Waste Management Checklists,
        Risk Registers and Safety files, all in accordance with applicable
        National legislative requirements. With the system being online based it
        adds quality to production by allowing users to complete all checklists
        in a digital, easy and quick way in real time and saving to a Safety
        File online.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user can generate reports and access all assessments, checklists and
        supporting documentation on the online Safety File on any mobile phone,
        tablet, notebook or laptop which makes it easier for Management, HR, and
        other members of Head office to monitor, evaluate and make quicker
        decisions to control any risks that were found at the workplace
        enhancing business productivity efficiently and effectively.

        their volunteers during the winter season via the plea on the 94.7
